This report outlines the exploratory data analysis conducted on the 'Weight Lifting Exercises' dataset in R, details of which can be found [here](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). The goal is to study the length of odontoblasts (teeth) in each of 10 guinea pigs at each of three dose levels of Vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg) with each of two delivery methods (orange juice or ascorbic acid).

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
